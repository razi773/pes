## 📋 Challenge Overview

The **Energy Utopia Challenge** invites participants to explore how Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize energy management and usage. This competition challenges teams to develop innovative AI-driven solutions that make energy systems smarter, greener, and more sustainable.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Energy systems worldwide face increasing complexity with:
- Rising energy demand
- Integration of renewable energy sources
- Need for efficient and reliable operations
- Traditional management methods becoming insufficient

The challenge: **Transform vast amounts of data from smart meters, sensors, and energy equipment into actionable insights using AI.**

## 🚀 Challenge Topics

Participants must choose **ONE** of the following four topics:

### 1. 🏢 Optimizing Energy Consumption
**Goal:** Use AI to understand and manage electricity usage in buildings, factories, and homes.

**Key Tasks:**
- Detect unusual consumption patterns and anomalies
- Predict future energy demand
- Provide recommendations for load shifting/reduction to save costs and energy

### 2. 🔋 Managing Energy Storage
**Goal:** Improve battery and storage system performance and lifetime using AI.

**Key Tasks:**
- Forecast remaining useful life (RUL) of storage systems
- Develop optimal charging/discharging strategies
- Detect early signs of degradation, overheating, or abnormal behavior

### 3. ☀️ Forecasting & Integrating Renewable Energy
**Goal:** Predict and manage variable renewable sources (solar, wind).

**Key Tasks:**
- Forecast renewable energy production based on weather data
- Detect gaps between expected and actual production
- Plan smart usage of storage and consumption based on forecasts

### 4. ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance of Energy Equipment
**Goal:** Ensure energy system reliability by anticipating failures.

**Key Tasks:**
- Detect anomalies in sensor data (temperature, vibration, voltage)
- Predict remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment
- Provide decision support for technicians linking past failures with current sensor signals

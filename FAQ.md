## üéØ Topic Selection

### Q5: Can I work on multiple topics?
**A:** No, you must choose ONE topic from the four available options and focus your solution on that specific area.

### Q6: How do I choose the best topic for my team?
**A:** Consider:
- **Data availability**: Which topic has data you can easily access?
- **Team expertise**: What skills does your team have?
- **Interest**: Which problem excites your team most?
- **Impact**: Where can you make the biggest difference?

### Q7: Can I combine multiple topics?
**A:** While your main focus should be on one topic, you can mention how your solution could extend to other areas. However, your primary deliverables should address one specific topic.

### Q8: What if I change my mind about the topic after Phase 1?
**A:** It's best to stick with your chosen topic, as changing it would require redoing most of your work. Choose carefully in the beginning.

## üìä Data Requirements

### Q9: Where can I find data for my project?
**A:** Several sources:
- **Public datasets**: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government open data portals
- **APIs**: Weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap), energy APIs
- **Web scraping**: Energy company websites, utility data
- **Simulation**: Generate realistic synthetic data
- **Research papers**: Many include datasets or links

### Q10: Can I use synthetic/simulated data?
**A:** Yes! The rules explicitly state you can generate realistic scenarios. Just make sure to document your simulation methodology clearly.

### Q11: How much data do I need?
**A:** There's no specific requirement, but you need enough data to:
- Train your AI model effectively
- Validate your results
- Demonstrate meaningful insights
Typically, thousands of data points for time-series tasks, or enough examples for classification tasks.

### Q12: Do I need to share my data publicly?
**A:** You should include your data (or a sample) in your GitHub repository, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain it. If using proprietary data, provide sample data or synthetic alternatives.

### Q13: Can I use proprietary/confidential data?
**A:** You can use it for development, but your final submission should be reproducible by others. Consider using anonymized versions or synthetic alternatives for your public repository.

## üíª Technical Questions

### Q14: What programming languages can I use?
**A:** Any programming language is acceptable, but Python is recommended due to its extensive AI/ML libraries and ecosystem.

### Q15: What tools and frameworks should I use?
**A:** Common choices include:
- **Languages**: Python, R, Julia
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost
- **Time Series**: statsmodels, Prophet, LSTM
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Deployment**: Flask, Streamlit, FastAPI, Docker

### Q16: Do I need to deploy my solution to the cloud?
**A:** Not required for Phase 1. For Phase 2, you should have a working demo (can be local), but cloud deployment is impressive and may earn extra points.

### Q17: What evaluation metrics should I use?
**A:** Depends on your topic:
- **Forecasting**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R¬≤
- **Classification** (anomaly/maintenance): Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- **Business**: Cost savings, efficiency improvements, energy reduction

### Q18: How complex should my model be?
**A:** Focus on effectiveness, not complexity. A simple model that works well is better than a complex model that doesn't. Document why you chose your approach.

## üîß GitHub & Submission

### Q32: Should my GitHub repository be public or private?
**A:** Public is recommended for visibility, but make sure it's anonymous. Private is acceptable if you prefer.

### Q33: Can I use Kaggle instead of GitHub?
**A:** The rules mention "GitHub repository and/or Kaggle notebook", so either is acceptable, or you can use both.

### Q34: What should my repository structure look like?
**A:** See PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md for a recommended structure. Key folders: data/, notebooks/, src/, models/, results/

### Q35: Where do I submit my deliverables?
**A:** Via the official submission link provided in the challenge (check the PDF or contact organizers for the exact link).

### Q36: Can I update my repository after the deadline?
**A:** The version at the deadline is what will be evaluated. Later updates won't be considered, so submit on time!

---

## ‚è∞ Deadlines & Timeline

### Q37: What timezone are the deadlines in?
**A:** GMT+1 (Central European Time - Tunisia time zone)

### Q38: Is there a grace period after the deadline?
**A:** This is not specified, so assume NO grace period. Submit early to avoid last-minute technical issues!

### Q39: What if I miss the Phase 1 deadline?
**A:** You likely won't be able to continue to Phase 2, as Phase 1 is the pre-selection phase.

### Q40: Can I submit Phase 1 early?
**A:** Yes! Submit as soon as you're ready. This gives you more time for Phase 2.

**A:** 
- Have at least one PES member: +1 point
- Have at least one YP member: +1 point  
- Have at least one member who is both YP and PES: +1 point
Maximum membership bonus: 3 points (not 5 as they're not all additive)

### Q43: Do I need to prove membership?
**A:** The submission rules don't specify, but be honest as this may be verified.

### Q44: Can members join IEEE PES or YP during the challenge?
**A:** Probably yes, but confirm with organizers. It's best to have memberships before the final submission.

## üè• Troubleshooting

### Q53: What if I can't find good data?
**A:** Options:
1. Simulate realistic data (document your methodology)
2. Try a different topic with better data availability
3. Combine multiple smaller datasets
4. Reach out to local utilities or companies (though this takes time)

### Q54: My model performance is poor. What should I do?
**A:** 
1. Check your data quality (missing values, outliers)
2. Try simpler models first (baseline)
3. Ensure proper train/test split
4. Consider more features or better feature engineering
5. Check for data leakage
6. Document your experiments - even "failed" attempts show good process

### Q55: I'm running out of time. What should I prioritize?
**A:** Priority order:
1. Get a working end-to-end solution (even if simple)
2. Document your process well
3. Create a clear demo
4. Make deliverables anonymous
5. Submit on time
Quality matters more than sophistication!
